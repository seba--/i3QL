/**
 * A cross product constructs all combinations of tuples in multiple relations.
 * Thus the cross product dramatically enlarges
 * the amount of tuples in it's output.
 * The new relations are anonymous tuples of the
 * warranted size and types of the cross product.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The cross product is not a self-maintained view.
 * In order to compute the delta of adding a tuple
 * to one of the underlying relations,
 * the whole other relation needs to be considered.
 *
 * This cross product  has the most general form, where a projection is immediately applied
 * without generating a tuple object for results.
 * The form where a tuple (DomainA,DomainB) is returned is more specific and can always be emulated by providing a
 * respective function.
